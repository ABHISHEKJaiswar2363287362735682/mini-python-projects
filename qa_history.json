        "question": "agent architecture",
        "answer": "In the provided context, the text doesn't directly discuss agent architecture. However, in AI, an agent architecture typically refers to the combination of the agent's sensors, actuators, a decision-making capability, and a way of learning to map sensors to actuators. Agent architectures can vary greatly, with examples including simple reflex agents, model-based reflex agents, goal-based agents, utility-based agents, and learning agents. If you need more specific information about AI architecture or aspects related to the text, please ask a more targeted question."

        "question": "AI problems",
        "answer": "The context provided does not detail potential problems or challenges related to AI. However, some common concerns in AI primarily revolve around privacy issues, job displacement due to automation, lack of transparency in decision-making, and ethical considerations in AI applications, among others.\n\nPrivacy issues can happen if AI systems collect, process, or use personal data without proper consent, leading to potential breaches and violations of user privacy. Job displacement due to automation is another major concern, as AI systems and automation technologies can contribute to job losses in specific industries. Lack of transparency occurs when the inner workings of an AI system are hidden, making it difficult for users to understand how the AI system makes decisions. Finally, ethical concerns may arise when AI systems make decisions that could potentially harm individuals or groups or violate human rights, such as using facial recognition in biased or discriminatory ways."
