The json module import seems to be separate and does not seem to be related to the issue at hand.\n\nThe error you encountered is likely due to the missing code that is supposed to be present between the `import json` and the rest of the script.

Identify the source of the error - based on the error message.\n2. Find and correct the mistake in the code.\n3. Verify the corrected code by:\n   a. Running the corrected code piece by piece and checking its behavior.\n   b.
